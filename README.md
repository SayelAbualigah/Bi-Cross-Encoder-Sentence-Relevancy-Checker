Features
Integrates a paraphrasing model to create alternative sentences.
Uses Bi-encoders for quick preliminary relevancy checks.
Employs Cross-encoders for in-depth relevancy analysis.
Provides a semantic similarity score to gauge relevancy.
Technologies
Paraphrasing Model (e.g., GPT-3)
Bi-Encoder and Cross-Encoder (e.g., BERT)
Python, Transformers, TensorFlow/PyTorch
